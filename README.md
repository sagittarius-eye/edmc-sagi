### Sagittarius Eye News Feed

The latest from *Sagittarius Eye* is shown in the corresponding application tab.
Simply click on any of the links to open a new tab showing the content.

# How to install

First you must install [Elite Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/blob/master/README.md)

Open the application and go to the plugins tab of the settings screen.

Click on `Open`. This will open the directory where you need to install the plugin.

Now, download the [latest release of the plugin](https://github.com/sagittarius-eye/edmc-sagi/releases/latest) and extract the folder into the directory you opened in the previous step.

**Restart EDMC** and the plugin will be properly loaded and you should be able to see the new labels on the main screen.

# Settings

In the SAGi tab of the settings page you will be able to configure settings about the plugin.

For now, the only option available is to disable the automated updates. 
Disabling auto-updates is not recommended as things may break when EDMC will update to a newer major version
which will change the way plugins are maintained. In order to stay up-to-date, you will either have to manually update the app
or leave this option unchecked.

More options will come if we chose to add features later on. For now, we wanted the plugin to stay as simple as possible for this initial release.
